        <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Web Accessibility can be website, tools, or tech that is created for users with disabilities.<br> 
        I feel that this is a great idea. I think that with these tools being created this will help anyone who is disablied be able to preform any type of web access without someones having to help them.<br>
      I feel that this is important to have so that you are not alienating anyone from being able to use your item that your created. If you have these type of helping tools they will help someone with disabilities be able to have a little freedom. 
      If you have these helping aids built into your website, tool, or tech this will put you in front of someone who is only thinking inside of the box and creating item for one type of user not for everyone to be able to use. In the IT world it is always good to think outside of the box.</p>

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive Enhancement is a web design that focuses on the user's experience on a website. It's main focus is on content and not just building a website.</p>
      <p>The reason that progessive enhancment is important in today's web development is because that is focus on the content of the site. Which in return will give the end user a better experience with the site that you built. If the user had a great experience on the site that user will return to your site and even maybe tell others about the site. In return you will start getting more foot traffic if your site content is pleasing to the eye.</p>
