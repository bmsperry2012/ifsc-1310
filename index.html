        <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Web Accessibility can be website, tools, or tech that is created for users with disabilities.<br> 
        I feel that this is a great idea. I think that with these tools being created this will help anyone who is disablied be able to preform any type of web access without someones having to help them.<br>
      I feel that this is important to have so that you are not alienating anyone from being able to use your item that your created. If you have these type of helping tools they will help someone with disabilities be able to have a little freedom. 
      If you have these helping aids built into your website, tool, or tech this will put you in front of someone who is only thinking inside of the box and creating item for one type of user not for everyone to be able to use. In the IT world it is always good to think outside of the box.</p>
